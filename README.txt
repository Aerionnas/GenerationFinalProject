This is a projects that I created while I was in the Junior Web Developer Course at Opportunity College. It is a Task Planner. For the purposes of the project, were not required to code the application completely. We only created 2 form in html that allow you to create a new task and to create a new user. 

For right now, users are able to add tasks and have those tasks save to cards. In order to make this happened, we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstap. 

To run this project, simply open createTask.html and try to add a new tasks. Also, our forms are validated and alerts the user when there is an issue.

Eventually, we would like to finish the entire application based on our wireframe and edit our program to
allow users to mark a task as complete.
